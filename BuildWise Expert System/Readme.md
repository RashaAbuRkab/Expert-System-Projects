### BuildWise Expert System 🏰️  

#### 📌 Introduction  
The Gaza Strip has suffered immense destruction due to war, creating an urgent need for intelligent, innovative solutions for reconstruction and recovery. **BuildWise** is an **expert system** designed to **assist engineers** in assessing building damage **efficiently and accurately**. Using **fuzzy logic**, it evaluates structural integrity and provides tailored **recommendations** for reconstruction.  

---  

#### 🛠️ Methodology: Fuzzy Reasoning  
The system follows a structured fuzzy logic approach:  

1️⃣ **Defining Linguistic Variables & Membership Functions**  
   - Inputs: Foundation Condition, Earth Stability, Basic Facilities, etc.  
   - Outputs: Damage Level, Infrastructure Validity, Recommendations.  
   - Uses **triangular & trapezoidal** membership functions for fuzzification.  

2️⃣ **Rule Creation**  
   - Establishes relationships between inputs & outputs using fuzzy rules.  
   - Example:  
     - *If Foundation is “Poor” AND Earth Stability is “Unstable” → Infrastructure is “Invalid”*.  
   - Incorporates factors like **Building Age, Number of Floors, and Bombing Exposure**.  

3️⃣ **Fuzzy Control System Construction**  
   - Implements the system using `skfuzzy` in Python.  

4️⃣ **Input Data Simulation**  
   - Accepts real-world building assessment data for **damage evaluation**.  

5️⃣ **Output Classification**  
   - Translates fuzzy results into meaningful **damage levels**:  
     - **≥ 70%** → **Total Damage** 🏣️  
     - **30% - 70%** → **Partial Damage** 🏠  
     - **< 30%** → **No Damage** ✅  
   - Generates **recommendations**: *Demolition, Repair, or No Action*.  

---  

#### 📊 Case Studies & Results  
🛇 **Case 1 (Minimal Damage)**  
   - Inputs: Strong foundation, stable earth, low exposure to bombing.  
   - **Predicted Damage:** **17.5%** → *No Damage*.  
   - **Recommendation:** Minor maintenance.  

🏷️ **Case 2 (Partial Damage)**  
   - Inputs: Good structural elements but **some cracks** & aging.  
   - **Predicted Damage:** **30.02%** → *Partial Damage*.  
   - **Recommendation:** **Repairs needed** at medium cost.  

🚨 **Case 3 (Total Damage)**  
   - Inputs: Old structure, **high bombing exposure**, unstable materials.  
   - **Predicted Damage:** **77.98%** → *Total Damage*.  
   - **Recommendation:** **Demolition & Reconstruction**.

#### 🔍 Backward Chaining Analysis  
The system **evaluates known facts** and **traces decisions back to root causes**:  
✅ *Proved:* **Severe Damage → Demolition Required** 🛇  
❌ *Not Proved:* **Minimal Damage** (Structural issues too significant).  

---  

#### 💡 Future Improvements  
✅ **Enhanced Rule Set** for more complex assessments.  
✅ **User-Friendly GUI** (a simple version is already built 🎨).  
✅ **Web/Mobile Deployment** for real-time field assessments.  

---  

#### 🏁 Conclusion  
**BuildWise** lays a solid foundation for **automated damage assessment**. With further **enhancements** in UI, rule expansion, and real-world deployment, it can become an **essential tool** for engineers, architects, and disaster response teams.
